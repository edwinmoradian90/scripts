# Bash Scripts 

### Various misc scripts that help with my everyday workflow.

# Installation

Clone the repo like this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwinmoradian90/scripts

```

Once cloned, place the scripts directory where ever you want and cd into it.

```bash
cd ./scripts

```

Finally, while in the scripts directory, run the scripts setup.

```bash
./setup_scripts

```

This will setup up your bashrc to include the scripts directory into your path and include required aliases.
After setup is completed, open a new terminal and you should be ready to go.

# Commands

### clone

The point of the clone command is to save time cloning a repo from GitHub. When I setup a new distro or setup a new computer, I find myself cloning the scripts and documents that I normally clone, so having to retype the same url five or more times can be a pain.
